zsh goodies for LHCb

## target audience
A collection of zsh completion functions to make everyday life of zsh users in
[LHCb](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/) easier.

## what's shipped and what's not
The package should not contain general zsh features which are useful outside of
LHCb as well. Instead it is planned to contain only features which are useful
to LHCb users only.
